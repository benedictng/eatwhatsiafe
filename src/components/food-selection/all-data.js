I never fancied a bagel so I didn't know what the big deal was. The set up is pretty simple, order from the menu, choose your bun and add extra toppings is you'd like. It's quite pricey but the serving is substantial! We ate half for breakfast and the other half for brunch hahahha! These guys have done something right because ever since I had my first bagel here, that's all I've been thinking of. Thank god I stay nearby. I'll definitely return and will specially make a trip down!"

I got the Sir Nels' (sage feta, egg, avocado, and tomato on a wholegrain bagel). Staff were lovely as well. Only complaint is that the sage feta is a tad too salty for me."
